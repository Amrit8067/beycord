Beycord
=======
In 2019, a person who called himself SunSOG began this discord bot as a hobby to learn to program and better his English. The progress and support was pretty decent, but unfortunately the project had to come to a closure on April 1st, 2021. Now, Beycord is revived as an open-source project! Everyone is welcomed to work on it.
