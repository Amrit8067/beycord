**Q: What does it mean by "open source"?**

A: Open source means the source code of the software is available for everyone to view. Having it open-sourced on GitHub also means that it is open to everyone, like literally `@everyone` to work on it without needing to get hired or fill up some application. You just need the knowledge and heart to contribute and that's pretty much it! You can check our contributing guidelines below.

**Q: When will Beycord be finished?**

A: The bot is close to complete \(as of July 8\), however a few errors are being fixed. \(`;knownbugs` shows a list of the known bugs\) If all bugs seem to be complete, we add fun new things to Beycord as often as possible, to make it truly the best discord bot ever!

**Q: How can I restore my data from Beycord V1?**

A: I get it. You worked very hard to earn many stuff in the original Beycord. Many of the exclusive beys were amazing beys to flex with! But, sadly, it isn't possible to restore or transfer data from Beycord V1. We're not trying to be mean, it simply isn't possible. A new database has taken its place so that everyone can develop the bot.

**Q: Why is Beycord offline / not working?**

A: There could be a number of reasons. The bot may be turned off due to a bug or maintenance, the VPS was shut down, or bot testing testing \(we don't want you messing up your Beycord account for trying out a new feature!\)
