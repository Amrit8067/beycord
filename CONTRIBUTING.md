# Contributing
Thanks a lot for being interested in contributing to this open-source project!

Below are a few things to take note of:
- Code contributions must match the current code style to prevent confusion. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) should be able to help you with checking.
- Pull requests must point to the [dev](https://github.com/SunSOG/beycord/tree/dev) branch instead of the [master](https://github.com/SunSOG/beycord/tree/master) branch.
- Be sure to check the [dev](https://github.com/SunSOG/beycord/tree/dev) branch and [open pull requests](https://github.com/SunSOG/beycord/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+) before working on a feature. Someone might've already been working on it so you should probably help them to improve it instead.
- Do not put unnecessary comments in your code such `// EpicGamer coded this part yeaaaaah`. The contributor section will credit you, you don't need to mess up the code with these comments.
- If you're planning to add a new feature, please discuss it with other contributors at the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZvQ6F6QSUB) first to make sure you know what you're doing and maybe get a few helpful suggestions.

Thanks for reading!
