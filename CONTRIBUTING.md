# Notes
- Code contributions must match the current code style to prevent confusion. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) should be able to help you with checking.
- Pull requests must point to the [dev](https://github.com/CorruptX/beycord/tree/dev) branch instead of the [master](https://github.com/CorruptX/beycord/tree/master) branch.
- Be sure to check the [dev](https://github.com/CorruptX/beycord/tree/dev) branch and [open pull requests](https://github.com/CorruptX/beycord/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+) before working on a feature. Someone might've already been working on it so you should probably help them to improve it instead.
- Do not put unnecessary comments in your code such `// EpicGamer coded this part yeaaaaah`. The contributor section will credit you, you don't need to mess up the code with these comments.
- If you're planning to add a new feature, please discuss it with other contributors at the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZvQ6F6QSUB) first to make sure you know what you're doing and maybe get a few helpful suggestions.

# Ways to contribute
- **Contributing code** You can help patch bugs and maybe even create an entirely new feature! You can merge your changes with the [parent repository](https://github.com/CorruptX/beycord) using [pull requests](https://github.com/CorruptX/beycord/compare).
- **Contributing ideas** Got an idea for a new feature or changes? Submit it at the [Issues](https://github.com/CorruptX/beycord/issues/new) section! We would like to hear your suggestion.
- **Bug hunting** If you found a bug in the code, we would appreciate it if you could report it at the [Issues](https://github.com/CorruptX/beycord/issues/new) section so we can patch it as soon as possible.

# I can't figure it out!
